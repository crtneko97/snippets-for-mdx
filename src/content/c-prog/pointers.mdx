# Working with Pointers

Pointers in C are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They let you directly read or modify data by referring to its location in memory.

## Basic Pointer Example

<CodeExample code={`
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int value = 42;
    int *ptr = &value;
    
    printf("Value: %d\\n", *ptr);
    return 0;
}
`} />

## Visualizing in Memory

Below is a simple diagram showing two variables in memory:  
- `value` at address `0x1000` holding `42`  
- `ptr` at address `0x1004` holding `0x1000` (the address of `value`)

<MemoryDiagram
  cells={[
    'Variable', 'Address', 'Value',
    'value',   '0x1000',  '42',
    'ptr',     '0x1004',  '0x1000'
  ]}
