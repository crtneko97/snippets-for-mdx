# Understanding Bitwise Operators

This interactive demo shows how the six main bitwise operators manipulate the individual bits of two numbers:

<BitwiseOperators />

## How They Work

- **AND (`&`)**: Sets each bit to 1 only if both bits are 1.  
- **OR (`|`)**: Sets each bit to 1 if one or both bits are 1.  
- **XOR (`^`)**: Sets each bit to 1 only if exactly one bit is 1.  
- **NOT (`~`)**: Flips every bit.  
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Moves bits left, filling in zeros on the right.  
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Moves bits right, discarding bits on the right.

Hover over the bits above to see each operation in action.
